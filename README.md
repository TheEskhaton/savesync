## What´s this project again?
Bananasync synchronizes the savegames of every game you could possibly own to the cloud of your choice!

## Steamsync, buddy?!
Steam has the option to synchronize your savegame to the Steamcloud which works perfectly fine in a lot of cases. Now what if you have a non-steam game which you don´t want to loose - like Minecraft? You´d have to upload your world to the cloud every time you finished playing. Sucks, right? And even after you uploaded your beloved world to the cloud of your choice, all of your other savegames are on the steamcloud. What if steam decides that they want money for it some day? We´ve got your back covered! Use Bananasync to take care of all the hours that you put into the game you love.
